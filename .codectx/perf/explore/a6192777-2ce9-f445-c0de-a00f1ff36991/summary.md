# Perf explore summary

## Analysis mode

- Mode: **static** (runtime measured: false)
- Findings describe code shape — not measured navigation latency. Next.js/Vite dev adds compile/HMR overhead; use interaction-probe (dev attach) for route transition + long-task evidence.
- Confirm tier: serve-oracle, http-health, route-probe, interaction-probe
- Recommended attach mode: **dev** — Use interaction-probe attachMode=dev against running dev server to measure sluggish page switches. Use route-probe attachMode=production for TTFB on prod-shaped builds.

## Fix queue — navigation blockers

_Red/yellow route, middleware, layout import, and barrel findings — highest user-impact._

- **Yellow** `perf:import:barrel-penalty:packages/obscur-conduit-mesh/src/index.ts` — Reduce barrel re-exports (27 wildcard re-exports, 1 hot-path importers in app/src tree) or lazy-load heavy subtree
- **Yellow** `perf:import:barrel-penalty:packages/ui-kit/src/index.ts` — Reduce barrel re-exports (24 wildcard re-exports, 147 hot-path importers in app/src tree) — top affected routes include `/download` (+5 more)
- **Yellow** `perf:import:barrel-penalty:packages/dweb-auth/src/index.ts` — Reduce barrel re-exports (13 wildcard re-exports, 22 hot-path importers in app/src tree) or lazy-load heavy subtree
- **Yellow** `perf:import:barrel-penalty:packages/obscur-engine-host/src/index.ts` — Reduce barrel re-exports (6 wildcard re-exports, 9 hot-path importers in app/src tree) or lazy-load heavy subtree
- **Yellow** `perf:import:barrel-penalty:packages/obscur-conduit-mesh-contracts/src/index.ts` — Reduce barrel re-exports (5 wildcard re-exports, 1 hot-path importers in app/src tree) or lazy-load heavy subtree
- **Yellow** `perf:import:barrel-penalty:packages/obscur-conduit-mesh-contracts/src/index.ts` — Reduce barrel re-exports (5 wildcard re-exports, 1 hot-path importers in app/src tree) or lazy-load heavy subtree

## Fix queue — other action items

_Red/yellow serve, API, topology boundary, and runtime findings — fix after nav blockers._

## Deferred confirm

Optional runtime validation: `perf.confirm.run` with `route-probe` or `serve-oracle` after static fixes.
