# Desktop App (Planned)

This directory is reserved for the upcoming Obscur Tauri v2 desktop application wrapper.

Planned goals:
- Secure key storage (OS keychain)
- Better desktop notifications
- File handling improvements (save/open)
- Deep links

## Relationship to the PWA

The desktop app will wrap the PWA UI and will aim to provide:

- Better platform integrations (file system, notifications)
- Safer local secret handling
- A smoother offline-first experience
