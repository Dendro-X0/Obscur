Obscur is a cross-platform, decentralized, end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) communication app focused on user privacy, ownership, and self-custody identity.

Project phase: **v1.4.7 Resilience & Verification — Released**

**Release highlights (`v1.4.7`):**

- **M0: Critical Fixes**: Ghost call prevention (5-minute TTL), profile isolation (complete cleanup), historical notification fixes
- **M1: Implementation Goals**: CAS Media Recovery (restore convergence), Security Integration (audit logging, identicon, key change detection), Relay Capability Badges (community mode display)
- **M2: Diagnostics & Verification**: M1 verification diagnostics and 7-test replay suite exposed via console API
- **M3: Stabilization**: Type fixes, comprehensive documentation, release preparation

**Previous release (`v1.4.6`):**

- **Security Hardening Suite**: Comprehensive identity and transport security improvements:
  - **Visual Identity Verification**: Deterministic identicon generation from public keys for cross-device identity confirmation,
  - **Key Change Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerts for unexpected contact identity changes,
  - **Relay Trust Scoring**: Dynamic health metrics and trust levels for relay selection (high/medium/low/untrusted),
  - **Encrypted Security Audit Log**: Local AES-GCM encrypted append-only security event logging.
- **Community UX Enhancements**: Relay capability badges, loading states, empty states, improved invite flows.
- **Theme Compatibility**: Full light/dark theme support across all security components.

**Earlier release (`v1.4.0`):**

- **CRDT Protocol Suite**: Complete implementation of 5-phase CRDT integration:
  - LWW-Registers for profile and presence state,
  - G-Counters for unread message counts and presence heartbeats,
  - OR-Sets for community membership with proper merge semantics,
  - Content-Addressed Media (CAS) for deduplicated blob storage,
  - Call State CRDT with TTL-based expiration to eliminate ghost calls.
- **Sync Protocol**: Full account-sync CRDT merge pipeline with namespace isolation, handler registration, and conflict resolution.
- **Infrastructure improvements**:
  - IndexedDB upgrade compatibility fixes for test environments,
  - All 1858 tests passing across 309 test files,
  - Type-safe CRDT operations with runtime validation.

The project remains independently developed, community-maintained, privacy-first, and local-first.

## Core Positioning

- Decentralized by design (relay-based transport, no required central server).
- Privacy-first messaging and community interactions.
- End-to-end encryption for private communications.
- User sovereignty through key-based identity and local-first ownership.
- Independently developed and community-maintained in public (not operated by a corporation or government agency).

## Trust and Transparency

- Public repository with auditable source code and open release history.
- Project policy guarantee: no intentional malicious code, hidden telemetry backdoors, or closed-source runtime logic in this repository.
- Security/privacy model and implementation history are documented in `/docs` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Release artifacts are published via GitHub Releases with reproducible version contracts.

## Key Capabilities

- Direct messaging and community/group messaging.
- Rich media messaging (image/video/audio/file).
- Voice notes and realtime voice call flow.
- Local vault/media workflows.
- Message deletion controls (`Delete for me` and `Delete for everyone` where supported by protocol flow).
- Light/dark themes, multilingual UI, and cross-platform UX parity improvements.
- Runtime diagnostics and triage tooling for long-term maintainability.

## Platform Coverage

- Web/PWA: `apps/pwa`
- Desktop (Tauri): `apps/desktop`
- Mobile targets via desktop runtime/tooling lane (Android/iOS support paths in repository workflows)

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Node.js `>=20.11.0`
- `pnpm`

Install and run PWA:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:pwa
```

Default local endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:3340`

Run desktop:

```bash
pnpm dev:desktop
```

## Deployment and Release

Current public distribution:

- GitHub Releases (primary channel)

Planned distribution:

- Official website (`apps/website`, under active planning), including:
  - changelog and release notes,
  - feature and architecture summaries,
  - short GIF demonstrations for production-build features,
  - downloadable release artifacts mirrored from GitHub Releases.

Release guard commands:

```bash
pnpm version:sync
pnpm version:check
pnpm docs:check
pnpm release:integrity-check
pnpm release:artifact-version-contract-check
pnpm release:ci-signal-check
pnpm release:test-pack
pnpm release:preflight -- --tag vX.Y.Z
```
